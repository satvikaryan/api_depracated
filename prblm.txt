Make a backend application on your favorite framework (Flask, Django, Spring Boot, Express etc ) that does the following -

Requirements
The backend application calls any stock price provider API (there are plenty of free stock price data providers)

Then create a REST API endpoint (let's call it R1) in your backend application and expose it

Now consume this REST API endpoint from Postman or any other API client

Write unit test for all your code

Request body -

jsx
Copy code

{

"ticker":"AAPL"

}

Response body -
jsx
Copy code

{

"AAPL": 189.05

}

Host your backend application on a free hosting place and submit the API endpoint to us

Please test all the code that it is working before submitting it

Bonus Points
These are optional requirements, but will give you some brownie points if you implement it -

Implement some kind of authentication in the REST API calls (hint - HTTP header authentication tag)
Evaluation Criteria
Use of correct HTTP methods

A working code hosted any free platform

Unit test coverage of code

The requirements very open ended because we want to evaluate your thinking and problem solving skills
